# Typescript template

This project contains baseline configuration files for a project that uses:

- Node (execution)
- Typescript (type checking)
- Eslint (linting)
- Prettier (formatting)
- Mocha (and chai and sinon)

Optionally, there are scripts for adding:

- AWS CDK (add-cdk.sh)
- Webpack (add-webpack.sh)

Usage;

```sh
git clone git@github.com:sbracegirdle/ts-template-2020.git my-project
cd my-project
./init.sh
```

Why run `init.sh`?  This way you install dependencies at the latest version rather than whatever version the template pins in package.json. This is also why package.json is empty.
